    Hi! I am Sebastian, a young programming enthusiast and this is my personal 
    blog. I am 16 years old and currently in my junior year. I participate in
    a lot of software development related contests and activities.
    This blog is mostly about the highlights of my life and personal opinions 
    related to coding. Check out my activity on
    <a href="https://github.com/MalesSebastian">Github</a> and 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/SebiMales">Twitter</a>.
