Hi! I am Sebastian, a young programming enthusiast and this is my personal 
blog. I am 16 years old and currently in my junior year. I participate in
a lot of software development related contests and activities.
This blog is mostly about the highlights of my life and personal opinions 
related to coding. Check out my activity on [Github](https://github.com/MalesSebastian) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SebiMales).

Thanks for reading!
